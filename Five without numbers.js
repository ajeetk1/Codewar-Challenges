// Description 
//Write a function that always returns 5
//Sounds easy right? Just bear in mind that you can't use any of the following characters: 0123456789*+-/
//Good luck :)

//My Solution 

// Remember 0123456789*+-/ - We don't have to use it:
// We can find lenth of String.

function unusualFive() {
let result = "Five!";   // Here we are declaring a special Character!
return result.length;
};
